{"name":"hydro3D","tagline":"HIGH ORDER LARGE EDDY SIMULATION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HYDRAULICS","body":"### Welcome to the hydro3D project.\r\n\r\nhydro3D is a finite difference Navier Stokes solver that permits accurate and efficient simulation of turbulent flows. It has been developed by Prof Thorsten Stoesser and collaborators Cardiff University, UK, and Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, primarily for use in the simulation of civil and environmental fluid dynamics. If you are interested in using and/or developing the code please contact stoesser@â€¦ .\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nSub-grid Scale (SGS) turbulent stress modelling using Smagorinsky or WALE methods.\r\nChoice of spatial discretisation schemes including 4th order central differences.\r\nChoice of temporal solution schemes including 5th order ENO/WENO.\r\nEfficient computation of flows in and over complex geometries using the Immersed Boundary Method.\r\nEfficient multigrid solver with MPI and OpenMP parallelisation.\r\nLocal mesh refinement for increased efficiency and accuracy.\r\n\r\n### Ongoing development\r\n\r\nBubble column simulation using Immersed Boundary particle tracking.\r\n1-equation SGS modelling.\r\nFree surface simulation in turbulent flows using the Level Set Method.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\nCodeDowloads TheoryGuide UserGuide FlowGallery DemoCases OurPublications\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
